By Royal University, a regular CV project is prepared for the final semester examination. 
It includes images, CSS styles, HTML, and PDF files. No permission is required for anyone to use it, 
as it is intended solely for project submission purposes and cannot be used for personal tasks.


However, if the project contains any sensitive data (e.g., 
personal information or personal images) and is intended 
for a specific service, then consent may be required to 
use that data.

Furthermore, the inclusion of personal information or materials used for purposes other than 
the project's objectives may require obtaining consent for such use. This project should not 
be used for personal purposes, and it is intended solely for educational purposes within an 
educational institution's designated submission process.
